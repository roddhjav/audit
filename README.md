**A [pass] extension for auditing your password repository.**


## Description
`pass audit` is a password-store extension for auditing your password repository.
Passwords will be checked against the Python implementation of Dropbox'
[`zxcvbn`][zxcvbn] algorithm and Troy Hunt's *Have I Been Pwned* Service.
It supports safe breached password detection from [haveibeenpwned.com][HIBP]
using a [K-anonymity][Kanonymity] method. Using this method, you do not need to
(fully) trust the server that stores the breached password. You should read the
[security consideration](#security-consideration) section for more information.


## Usage

```
usage: pass audit [-h] [-V] [-n NAME] [-v | -q] [pass-names]

 A pass extension for auditing your password repository. It supports safe
 breached password detection from haveibeenpwned.com using K-anonymity method,
 duplicated passwords, and password strength estimation using zxcvbn.

positional arguments:
  pass-names            Path(s) to audit in the password store, If empty audit the full store.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -V, --version         Show the program version and exit.
  -n NAME, --name NAME  Check only passwords with this filename
  -v, --verbose         Set verbosity level, can be used more than once.
  -q, --quiet           Be quiet.

More information may be found in the pass-audit(1) man page.
```

See `man pass-audit` for more information.


## Examples

**Audit a subfolder for pwned passwords**
```
pass audit goodpasswords/
(*) None of the 7 passwords tested are breached.
 .  But it does not means they are strong.
```

```
pass audit pwnedpasswords/
 w  Password breached: password from Password/pwned/5 has been breached 3303003 time(s).
 w  Password breached: correct horse battery staple from Password/pwned/2 has been breached 2 time(s).
[x] Error: 7 passwords tested and 2 breached passwords found.
 .  You should update them with 'pass-update'.
```


## Security consideration

**K-anonymity**

This program uses K-anonymity to retrieve the knowledge of breached passwords
from HIBP server. K-anonymity applied to breached password check on an untrusted
remote server is a recent cryptographic approach. It means only the first five
characters of the SHA1 hash of your password is sent to the server. It offers
decent anonymity; nevertheless, it is not an entirely secure solution.

**Mandatory Access Control (MAC)**

AppArmor profiles for `pass` and `pass-audit` are available in 
[`apparmor.d`][apparmor.d]. If your distribution support AppArmor, you can
clone the [apparmor.d] and run: `sudo ./pick pass pass-import` to only install
these AppArmor security profiles.

**Network**

pass-audit only needs to establish network connection to connect to the
[haveibeenpwned.com][HIBP] server.

**Password Update**

You might also want to update the passwords imported using [`pass-update`][update].


## Installation [<img src="https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/pass-audit.svg" align="right">][repology-link]

**Requirements**
* `pass 1.7.0` or greater.
* Python 3.6+
* `python3-setuptools` to build and install it.
* `python3-requests` (`apt install python3-requests` or `pip3 install requests`)
* `python3-zxcvbn` (`pip3 install zxcvbn`)

**ArchLinux**

`pass-audit` is available in the [Arch User Repository][aur].
```sh
yay -S pass-audit  # or your preferred AUR install method
```

**Debian/Ubuntu**

`pass-audit` is available under my own debian repository with the package name
`pass-extension-audit`. Both the repository and the package are signed with
my GPG key: [`06A26D531D56C42D66805049C5469996F0DF68EC`][keys].
```sh
wget -qO - https://pkg.pujol.io/debian/gpgkey | sudo apt-key add -
echo 'deb [arch=amd64] https://pkg.pujol.io/debian/repo all main' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pkg.pujol.io.list
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install pass-extension-audit
```

**FreeBSD**
```sh
# install the binary package
pkg install py36-pass-audit

# or build it using the ports tree
make -C /usr/ports/security/py-pass-audit install clean
```

**Using pip**
```sh
pip install pass-audit
```

**From git**
```sh
git clone https://github.com/roddhjav/pass-audit/
cd pass-audit
python3 setup.py install
```

**Stable version**
```sh
wget https://github.com/roddhjav/pass-audit/releases/download/v1.2/pass-audit-1.2.tar.gz
tar xzf pass-audit-1.2.tar.gz
cd pass-audit-1.2
python3 setup.py install
```

[Releases][releases] and commits are signed using [`06A26D531D56C42D66805049C5469996F0DF68EC`][keys].
You should check the key's fingerprint and verify the signature:
```sh
wget https://github.com/roddhjav/pass-audit/releases/download/v1.2/pass-audit-1.2.tar.gz.asc
gpg --recv-keys 06A26D531D56C42D66805049C5469996F0DF68EC
gpg --verify pass-audit-1.2.tar.gz.asc
```

**Local install**

Alternatively, from git or a stable version you can do a local install with:
```sh
cd pass-audit
python3 setup.py install --user
```
Remember to set `PASSWORD_STORE_ENABLE_EXTENSIONS` to `true` for the local
extension to be enabled.
