Description: A password store extension for auditing a password repository.
 Passwords will be checked against the Python implementation of Dropbox' zxcvbn
 algorithm and Troy Hunt's Have I Been Pwned Service. It supports safe breached
 password detection from haveibeenpwned.com using a K-anonymity method. Using
 this method, you do not need to (fully) trust the server that stores the
 breached password. You should read the security consideration section for more
 information.
